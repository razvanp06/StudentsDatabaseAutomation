    ~~Student Database Automation~~

The bash script uses students.csv and courses.csv, two files with info about a number of students and their courses, domain, gpa, first and last name.
The purpose is to process all data from the files and insert it into 4 different tables: students (info about each student), majors, courses and majors_courses (junction table used for many-to-many relationship between majors and students).
